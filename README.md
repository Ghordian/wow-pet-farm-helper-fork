Pet Farm Helper-Fork
===============

Add-on that shows which battle pets can be farmed this week. More than 250 pets added/reviewed!

By means of :

	1) go to the raid/dungeon/world zone;
 
	2) localize the boss/rare/elite;
 
	3) kill him and loot. Good luck or Justice!

For pets that need grinding (it is, drop ratio < 0.1%) just feel free to visit a zone and kill mobs 'til the end of the day.
